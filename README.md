# business-website
This is a business website project.

To be honest, it's spaghetti code. It's all over, and if another webdev saw it in this state now, they'd probably get a heart attack.
But I'm sticking with it. I know it's the basic minimum for a webpage. I went through tutorials and lectures and tried to experiment with everything I learned.
I added different elements all over, even created a custom one. My css was not done in order. I didn't leave any /**/ notes. This was a learning experience for me.
This project was my first webpage. The first I ever created that looks like a modern webpage. This is my mark now, this is where I have started, and only time will tell where I ended. I am seriously hoping it's somewhere nice. I am hopeful however, because I seriously enjoy this.
Thanks for checking it out!
